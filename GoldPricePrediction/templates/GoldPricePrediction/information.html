        <p>
            A cumulative return on an investment is the aggregate amount that the investment 
            has gained or lost over time, independent of the amount of time involved. The cumulative 
            return is expressed as a percentage, and it is the raw mathematical return of the following calculation:
            <br>[(Current Price of Security)−(Original Price of Security)]/(Original Price of Security)​

        <h2 class ="h2-h3">Moving averages</h2>
        <p>
            The moving average (MA) is a simple technical analysis tool that smooths out price data 
            by creating a constantly updated average price. The average is taken over a specific period 
            of time, like 3 days, 9days.

        <h2 class ="h2-h3">Sharpe ratio</h2>
        <p>
            The ratio describes how much excess return you receive for the extra volatility you endure 
            for holding a riskier asset. Usually, any Sharpe ratio greater than 1.0 is considered acceptable 
            to good by investors. A ratio higher than 2.0 is rated as very good. A ratio of 3.0 or higher is 
            considered excellent. A ratio under 1.0 is considered sub-optimal.

        <h2 class ="h2-h3">R-squared</h2>
        <p>
            R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. 
            It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination 
            for multiple regression. The definition of R-squared is fairly straight-forward; it is the percentage 
            of the response variable variation that is explained by a linear model.
            <br>R-squared is always between 0 and 100%:<br>            
                1] 0% indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean.<br>
                2]100% indicates that the model explains all the variability of the response data around its mean.<br>            
            In general, the higher the R-squared, the better the model fits your data. However, there are important 
            conditions for this guideline that I’ll talk about both in this post and my next post.
